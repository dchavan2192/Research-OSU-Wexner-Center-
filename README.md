# Research @ tOSU Wexner Center  
**Data Analysis on Patient Outcomes in Assistive Technology**

---

## 📊 Overview

- Explored patient data from the Wheelchair Service Delivery process at OSU's Assistive Technology Clinic.
- Patient outcomes were measured using the **Functional Mobility Assessment (FMA)**, a self-report tool that ranges from 0–60 (higher = better outcome).
- Performed statistical analysis to investigate how **demographics and clinical factors** affect FMA scores.
- The goal was to highlight the impact of **seating and mobility equipment interventions** on patient outcomes.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Python**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `statsmodels`
- **Microsoft Excel**
- **Microsoft Word** (for documentation & summaries)

## 📈 Code and Results

### 🔹 Weight vs FMA Score

![Weight Distribution](weightPosterv2.png)

This plot displays the distribution of patient weights.  
A **Pearson correlation test** showed a negative relationship: as **weight increases**, FMA scores tend to **decrease**.

### 🔹 Funding Source vs FMA Score

![Funding Source vs FMA](fundingSourceFont23v3.png)

This boxplot shows FMA scores grouped by different **funding sources** (insurance types).  
Using **Tukey's HSD**, we concluded that patients with **public funding** generally had **lower FMA scores** than those with private insurance.
