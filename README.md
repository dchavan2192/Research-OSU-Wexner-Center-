# Research @ tOSU Wexner Center: Data Analysis on patient outcomes in the field of assistvie technology
## Overview:
- Taking a look into the insights of patient data in the Wheelchair Service delivery process
- A way to measure patient outcomes is by using a performance-based self-report tool known as FMA (Functional Mobility Assessment)
- The FMA ranges from 0-60 where a higher score corresponds to a positve patient outcome
- Using patient data, I can perform a multitude of statistical tests comparing demographic data and how FMA plays a role
- This is all done to highlight the impact of seating and mobility equipment interventions performed at the Ohio State University Assistive Technology Clinic 

## Tools used for Data Analysis
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Statsmodels)
- Microsoft Excel 
- Microsoft Word

## Deeper Look into Code and Results

![Weight Distribution](weightPosterv2.png)
This distribution shows the weight distribution among patients. I conducted a Pearson Correlation Test to determine that as weight increased, FMA score decreased.
Here is the code!

![Funding Source vs FMA](fundingSourceFont23v3.png)
Boxplot showcases the FMA distribution grouped by different funding sources/insurances of the patient. Using Tukey's HSD, came to the conclusion that individuals who have public funding source types tend to have a lower FMA score than private funding sources.
Here is the code!
